# 1.研究背景

## 机器学习是什么

 从广义上来说，机器学习是一种能够赋予机器学习的能力以此让它完成直接编程无法完成的功能的方法。但从实践的意义上来说，机器学习是一种通过利用数据，训练出模型，然后使用模型预测的一种方法。

## 机器学习与土木工程的结合

 Civil engineering refers to the technical work and completion of survey, planning, design, construction, installation and maintenance of buildings, structures and related supporting facilities for the construction, reconstruction or expansion of various types of projects in addition to building construction. Engineering entity. Due to the discipline characteristics of civil engineering, the application of machine learning in civil engineering is paralyzed. And because some of the geotechnical engineering is extremely complicated, it is difficult to explain clearly with the mechanics principle, or the problem of using empirical formulas, these become the fields that machine learning can be applied. There are very few cases in which machine learning is applied to civil engineering at home and abroad. Therefore, the author only selected the research that Feng Xiating had done before.

The project can be seen as an open and complex giant system that is constantly changing, so it can be handled by a method that effectively processes open complex giant systems, namely, qualitative and quantitative integrated methods. Applying the theories of emerging disciplines such as systems science, artificial intelligence, neural networks and fuzzy mathematics, comprehensively studying the uncertainties and engineering experience of the system, developing a practical and feasible method of mechanical analysis to solve complex slope engineering problems. It combines the whole system of process geology, sub-division design, construction, monitoring and correction, and makes the mechanical analysis and engineering design adaptive and self-learning. This method uses neural network theory and attempts to establish a nonlinear model between various geological and engineering factors and safety factors of slopes using self-learning methods. This model is then used to predict the safety factor of the new slope.

The author collected 82 examples of dangerous arc-destroyed slopes from the literature and more than 30 open-pit mines in China (including 4 destruction examples, 38 stable examples) and dangerous wedge failure examples (8 destructions, 6 stable). ).

In the neural network estimation of slope stability caused by dangerous arc damage, various factors affecting slope stability, such as rock bulk density, cohesion, internal friction angle, slope angle, slope height, pore pressure ratio, etc. Node expression. The safety factor and the slope stability state are stabilized or destroyed by the output node of the network. The network predicts the unlearned samples, and the prediction accuracy of the slope state in n samples is 10%. There are 9 relative errors of safety factor less than 5%, 2 relative errors of about 7 %, and one relative error of 30%. The average relative error of the maximum likelihood method for the safety factor estimate is 33%.

Slope stability in dangerous wedge failure Neural network estimation, various factors affecting slope stability, such as rock bulk density, cohesion and internal friction angle of two structural planes, slope angle, slope height, wedge intersection Line inclination and the like are expressed by the input nodes of the network. The safety factor and the slope stability (stability or destruction) are expressed by the output nodes of the network. The network predicts the unlearned samples, and the relative error of the safety factor is less than 6%. The relative error of the maximum likelihood method for estimating the safety factor is 20%.

It can be seen from the above two examples that after learning the examples in the neural network, the un-learned instances are generalized and predicted, the prediction accuracy of the slope state is 100%, and the prediction of the safety factor is 90% relative. The error is below 7%. It embodies the characteristics of high prediction accuracy, strong self-learning ability and strong uncertainty in considering the neural network method. The use of the limit equilibrium method for slope safety factor estimation is sometimes cumbersome and highly dependent on the user's experience.

 The occurrence of rockburst is affected by many factors, such as geological structure, mining method, depth of mining, relationship between working direction and geological structure and supporting effect, but the mechanism of rockburst is still not clear so far. There is still no clear understanding of how these factors affect rockburst and its relationship with rockburst, so it is extremely difficult to predict rockburst using traditional rockburst analysis methods. In this case, artificial rock, expert system and intelligent rock mechanics developed by the intersection and fusion of neural network and rock mechanics provide a good analytical method. The support vector machine is based on Vapnick's structural risk minimization principle, which maximizes the generalization ability of the learning machine. It has a stronger theoretical basis and better generalization performance than the neural network learning algorithm of the empirical risk principle. In addition, the support vector The machine algorithm is a convex quadratic optimization problem, which can guarantee that the extremum solution is the global optimal solution. The use of SVM for rockburst prediction is to find the relationship between the factors affecting rockburst and the occurrence of rockburst.,

They are used to predict rockbursts in tunnels, VCR stops, and carbon mining sites.
For the prediction of the tunnel, the factors considered are the depth of the burial, the type of geological structure, the inclination, the width, the type of permanent support, the effect, and the height of the tunnel. 50 examples were randomly selected for learning, 21 of which were Examples of rockbursts occur, and 29 are examples of no rockburst. Through testing a variety of kernel functions and a large number of parameters, it is found that the best model is a polynomial kernel function and d is 3, the parameter C value is 0.3, and 32 support vectors are obtained after learning. The learning sample and 8 test samples are used for prediction, in which the number of learning sample errors is 3 and the number of test sample errors is 1.

 For rockburst predictions of VCR stope, the factors to be considered are buried depth, type of geological structural face, dip angle, width, mining method, temporary support, type of permanent support and regional support, width of stope and strike span. Etc., randomly selected 80 samples for learning. Through testing a large number of parameters and multiple kernel functions, it is found that the best model is a polynomial kernel function and d is 2, and the parameter C is 20. After learning. A total of 43 support vectors were obtained. This model was used to predict 80 learning samples and 24 test samples, where the number of learning sample errors was 2 and the number of test sample errors was 1.
The carbon mining stope is similar to the VCR stope. 70 samples were randomly selected. Through testing a large number of parameters and multiple kernel functions, the best model was found to be a polynomial kernel function and d was 2, and the parameter C was 0.15. After learning, the support vector was obtained. 39, using this model to predict 70 learning samples and 7 test samples, in which the number of learning sample errors is 1, and the number of test sample errors is 0.

 It can be seen from the establishment of the rockburst prediction model that it is relatively simple to build a model with SVM, and the data of each factor need not be processed, and it can be either Boolean or integer or decimal.

Displacement is one of the important information that is fed back during the evolution of geotechnical structure. Modeling with monitored displacement can predict the future evolution law and development trend of geotechnical structures, and timely grasp the changing laws of geotechnical structures, which is of great significance in engineering. The main methods used for displacement time series are the traditional time series analysis method and the neural network method of intelligent rock mechanics. The traditional time series analysis method is to use the historical displacement of observation to establish a statistical model of prediction. This model does not need to know the geotechnical soil. The mechanical processes and mechanisms in the structure have certain advantages; however, this statistical model is generally used when there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable or some simple functional relationship, and there is no statistical significance when the data is too small; The neural network method of intelligent rock mechanics is also a learning method based on large samples. Due to the complexity of geotechnical structures, the engineering geological conditions and rock mass parameters involved are usually uncertain and fuzzy. There are very complex nonlinear relationships between the various factors affecting the characteristics of the rock mass system. Determining the mathematical model description, which makes the traditional method insufficient. The recently developed support vector machine method is a new learning method based on statistical learning theory. It is not necessary to know the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable. By learning the sample, the dependent variable and the independent variable can be obtained very much. Complex mapping relationships; at the same time, it is a learning method based on small samples, which can be modeled without having to know too much data. The method is applied to the slope deformation of Wolong Temple and the deformation prediction of the slope of the Three Gorges Yong Ship Lock. The results show that the method has the advantages of scientific, reliable and real-time, and has broad application prospects.
